Chorus
Such boundless and unique love with you
And no longer free, like a madman, I live with you
100 thousand steps, I will take the fastest steps to you
100 thousand years are not worth a single day without you

Your name is written with stars
In the sky of my soul.
When destinies were reconciled with destinies,
God left you to me
I am fascinated by you, like a miracle.
I catch your look at happiness.
Madly in love without consciousness
In your incredible beauty

Chorus

Your voice carries the wind for miles
Dancing a minuet with him
And the sea with unstoppable waves
Draws only your silhouette
You with kisses, touch
I will put on my love
And I will thank God in a whisper
Because you are my happiness

Chorus 2

So limitless and unique...
And no longer free, like crazy...
100 thousand steps, I will take the fastest steps to you
100 thousand years are not worth a single day without you
100 thousand steps, I will take the fastest steps to you
100 thousand years are not worth a single day without you
